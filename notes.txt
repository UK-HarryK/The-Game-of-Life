Conway's Game of Life notes 

Birth rule:- To be born, a dead cell needs to have three live neighbours
Life rule:- Any live cell with two or three neighbours survives
Death rule:- Any live cell with <2 neighbours dies, any live cells with >3 neighbours dies 

start at generation zero, allow the user to create their own pattern of cells 

define a class for the cells, maybe with properties that determine if the cells have any neighbouring live cells?
Cell pattern
1 2 3
4 c 5
6 7 8
Array of 8 boolean values the determine if a neighbouring cell is alive
